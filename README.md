# Image Processing Project

This project demonstrates basic image processing techniques using OpenCV and NumPy in Python. The operations performed include:

1. **Image Importing**: Loading an image from the local directory.
2. **Image Resizing**: Resizing the image to a smaller dimension (250x250).
3. **Grayscale Conversion**: Converting the image to grayscale format.
4. **Histogram Equalization**: Enhancing the contrast of the image.
5. **Adding Gaussian Noise**: Adding simulated Gaussian noise to the image.
